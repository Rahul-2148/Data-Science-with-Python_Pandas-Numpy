# ðŸ“Š Key Terms in **Matplotlib (MATLAB Plotting Library)**

Matplotlib is a powerful plotting library in Python used for 2D visualizations. Here are the essential terms to understand:

---

## ðŸ”¹ Basic Plotting Elements

1. **Data Point**  
   A single observation in the graph, shown as a dot, mark, or shape.

2. **X-axis / Y-axis**  
   The horizontal and vertical reference lines used to represent data dimensions.

3. **Figure**  
   The full window or page or canvas that holds the plot(s), axes, labels, legends, and titles.

4. **Figure Size**
   The size of the figure (width, height) in inches. 

5. **Axes**  
   The part of the figure where the data is plotted (not to be confused with plural of axis).

6. **Plot**  
   A graphical representation (like a line, bar, or scatter plot) of your data.

## ðŸ”¹ Styling and Labeling

7. **Marker**  
   A symbol (like `o`, `*`, `s`) used to show individual data points.(`'o'` is a circle, `'*'` is a star, `'s'` is a square, etc.)

8. **Line Style**  
   The format of lines connecting data (`'-'`, `'--'`, `':'`, `'-.'`).

9. **Color**  
   Visual appearance applied to elements to distinguish or highlight data.

10. **Legend**  
   A key that identifies different data series using labels and colors/markers.

11. **Label**  
   A text name describing a dataset or axis. 

12. **Title**  
   A short heading at the top of the figure describing the entire plot.

13. **Axis Label**  
   Descriptive text on the X or Y axis (`xlabel`, `ylabel`).

14. **Functions**
    Function wo block of code hote h jo specific task perform krte h, matplolib me jo functions h like plot, show, etc.

15. **Methods**
    Method me fuction jo ek object ko belong krta h jaise ki list, string ya figure object etc. jaise MatpltLib me bhot sare functions via By Plot ke dware use kiya jata h, but in advanced cases like Object Oriented AI waha pe methods use kiya jata h.

16. **Parameters**
    It refers to the arguments or input values that are passed to a function or method.

17. **Key Arguments** 
    These are arguments that have a default value and can be changed by the user.

18. **Object Oriented API**
    It's a programming approach where objects are used to represent real-world entities and interactions between objects are modeled using methods and attributes.

19. **DPI (Dots Per Inch)**
    A measure of the resolution of an image, typically used in graphics and printing. It's the number of pixels per inch.

## ðŸ”¹ Axis Configuration

20. **Axis Scale**  
   Defines how values are distributed along the axis (linear, log, etc.).

21. **Axis Limit**  
   The minimum and maximum values shown on an axis (`xlim`, `ylim`).

22. **Axis Tick**  
   Small marks or lines that denote intervals or specific values on axes.

23. **Axis Tick Label**  
   Text accompanying ticks to show the actual values.

## ðŸ”¹ Types of Plots

24. **Line Plot**  
   Displays trends by connecting data points with lines.

25. **Scatter Plot**  
   Shows points individually to highlight distribution or relationships.

26. **Bar Plot**  
   Represents data with rectangular bars (vertical or horizontal).

27. **Histogram**  
   Groups continuous data into bins and shows frequency as bars.

28. **Pie Chart**  
   Displays proportional data as slices of a circular pie.

29. **Box Plot (Box-and-Whisker)**  
   Summarizes data distribution using quartiles, median, and outliers.

30. **Violin Plot**  
   Combines a box plot with a rotated KDE (density) plot for deeper insight.

31. **Heatmap**  
   Uses color gradients to represent matrix or grid data values.

32. **Contourf Plot**  
   A filled contour plot that represents 3D data in 2D using filled color areas.

33. **Quiver Plot**  
   Plots vectors as arrows to show direction and magnitude.

34. **Stream Plot**  
   Visualizes continuous vector fields with streamlines (like fluid flow).

âœ… **Tip:**  
Use `plt.figure()` to create a figure, `plt.plot()` or `ax.plot()` for line plots, and always add labels (`xlabel`, `ylabel`, `title`, `legend`) for clarity.
